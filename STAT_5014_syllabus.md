### Course details

This course endeavors to build competence in R and Python programming.  We will use Swirl to reinforce the programming concepts. As we explore programming methods, we will use Rmarkdown for document typesetting. In the process of working through this course, you will gain familiarity with version control and \LaTeX via markdown. The course will include, but is not restricted to, the following programming topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item R, Rmarkdown, Rprojects, Rnotebooks
\item Git as a code repository
\item Functions, conditional statements and loops in R
\item Base and grammer of graphics (ggplot2) in R
\item Apply family of functions in R
\item Matrix and vector math in R
\item Python  
\item Parallel computing
\item JMP and SAS
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the process of learning the above programming methods and platforms, we may also explore the following statistical methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploratory Data Analysis tools
    \item Linear regression
    \item ANOVA
    \item Monte Carlo procedures
    \item Power
\end{itemize}

### Honor System  

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.  

\noindent The Virginia Tech honor pledge for assignments is as follows: __*"I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment."*__
